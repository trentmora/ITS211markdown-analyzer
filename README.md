This is a simple Python program that scans a given directory for
Markdown (.md) files, and analyzes the content of these files by 
creating a corresponding representative object for each Markdown file.

Then these representative objects are aggreated into a single report.txt
through FileAnalysis.

What the Program Does:
    Given a folder path from the user, the program:
        • Finds all .md files in the directory
        • Creates a FileStatus object for each file
        • Analyzes each file to determine:
            • Whether it contains YAML metadata (---)
            • Whether it mentions “GPT”
            • How many words it contains (letters only, ≥ 3 characters)
            • Identifies orphaned files (files with zero valid words)
        • Outputs:
            • A summary in the terminal
            • A detailed report.txt file

FileStatus
    Represents a single Markdown file and stores:
        • File path
        • YAML status
        • GPT status
        • Word count

Each analysis method updates the object’s internal state, which is later 
accessed through getter methods.

    FileAnalysis
    Works with a list of FileStatus objects to:
        • Count files with YAML
        • Count files mentioning GPT
        • Sum total words
        • Count orphaned files
        • Write the final report
